# Alexa Reads Trump Tweets

I made this to allow Alexa to read Donald Trump tweets on @realDonaldTrump. Ask her to "Ask Trump to read a tweet" and she will read off the most recent tweet to you as best she can. 

## Issues

Please let me know which tweets she doesn't read well. Make an issue with the link to the tweet or the day it was tweeted if you can. Thanks. 

## Developing/Running

Just make a secrets.js file containing the proper input for the Twitter client NPM repo and it should start working for you.
